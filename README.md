# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with thorough communication and gathering clear requirements. User stories are essential in this process, as they break down complex needs into specific, actionable tasks. Each story centers on a particular user goal or feature, which helps prioritize development efforts according to user impact.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to development emphasizes Agile practices, particularly iterative development and regular feedback. I find that short, focused Sprints make it easier to manage large projects by breaking them into smaller, achievable tasks, allowing adjustments as needed. Moving forward, I intend to apply Scrum practices like daily stand-ups, Sprint planning, and retrospectives to keep communication open and ensure the project’s progress.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

good team member in software development values collaboration, transparency, and responsibility. It’s important to share ideas freely, offer help when others need it, and be clear about one’s own progress or challenges.
